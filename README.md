```

##Usage

```
Usage: goat [-c,--cheatsheet <answers>]
            [-h,--help]
```

Got your heart set on a certain occupation? Are you Freddie Gomez? You may pass a cheatsheet of pre-answers.

Use:

```
goat -c 1111123432
```

And *poof*: You're a waste management specialist.

If your cheatsheet contains any character besides [1-4], it will still prompt you to answer that question.
